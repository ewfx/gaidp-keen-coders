## 🎯 Introduction
We will develop a solution that can generate data profiling rules, perform adaptive risk scoring and suggest remediation actions based on regulatory reporting instructions.

## 🎥 Demo

## 💡 Inspiration
Regulatory reporting in the banking sector involves compiling vast amounts of data to meet compliance requirements. A critical aspect of this process is data profiling, which ensures that the reported data aligns with regulatory reporting instructions. Traditaionally, this involves manually defining profiling rules based on the underlying data and regulatory requirements. This project aims to automate data profiling using Generative AI (LLMs) and unsupervised machine learning techniques. we will develop a solution that can generate data profiling rules, perform adaptive risk scoring and suggest remediation actions based on regulatory reporting instructions.

## ⚙️ What It Does
1. Process regulatory documents and extract validation rules
2. Generate Python validation code from extracted rules
3. Profile data using unsupervised learning techniques
4. Detect anomalies using Isolation Forest
5. Calculate risk scores for data records based on rule violations
6. Generate remediation suggestions for high-risk records

## 🛠️ How We Built It
1. Python
2. google.generativeai
3. crewai

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
We dont have realtime data to explore more on the solution. We created some dummy data and created project.

## 🏃 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/ewfx/gaidp-keen-coders.git
2. Install dependencies  
   pip install -r requirements.txt (for Python)
3. Run the project  
   ```sh
   python genai-data-profiling.py
   ```
